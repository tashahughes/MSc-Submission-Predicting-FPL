# MSc-Submission-Predicting-FPL

This file is written to provide a brief overview of all of the functions and scripts provided in this submission, including the neccesary file order. You may have to write in your file path at each stage, I haven't included this so I'd suggest opening a notebook window in the path the folder is downloaded to.

1. Utils.py: this script contains most of the neccessary helper functions used throughout the project. It has been provided in this format to shorten each individual notebook.

2. Imports.ipynb: contains the necessary data imports, formatting and cleaning operations

3. Predictions.ipynb: contains the modelling scripts

4. Initialisation.ipynb: linear programming outputs for gameweek 1. Also contains a baseline approach.

5. TransferAlgorithm.ipynb: contains the transfer algorithm outputs for each model as well as final season evaluations for each configuration

6. BonusChip.ipynb: contains the final results with Bonus Chip usage added. Considered as the 'end product'

In addition there are a number of additional scripts which were used to explore the data and results further such as EDA.ipynb and Postprocessing.ipynb which you can look at if you wish, but they aren't neccessary for gathering results. They are commented, but quite messy and seemingly random in places, they were more for my personal understanding to support ideas I had during analysis.
